I am a 2nd Year Mechatronics and AI undergraduate student with minor in Computer Science Engineering at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhagalpur. I like working on Deep Neural Networks and have a great interest in Computer Vision.
I am quiet fascinated by Generative Adversial Networks and Deepfakes, though my knowledge pertaining them is limited.
I also enjoy Front End Web Development since it's a known fact that beauty of Front End can even be understood by non-coders.
I have worked as a Subject Matter Expert in Machine Learning with Intellify which is an IIT -Delhi based startup that aims at providing quality learning content to NGO's and government schools. During my internship period I prepared video lectures plus the lecture slides on the topics such as Predictive Modelling, Logistic Regression, Dimensionality Reduction, Regularization, Neural Networks, Preprocessing Techniques and also full Scikit - learn tutorial. The videos which have been uploaded till date on Intellify's youtube channel have already gathered innumerable views and load of appreciating comments.
Apart from these things, I like being punctual and always finishing whatever I start. I am a quiet flexible and can easily get along well with all people. I am a good listener and can confidently communicate my ideas too when needed.
